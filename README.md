# SelectWorld
Bukkit plugin request (https://bukkit.org/threads/selectworld.502146/)
For Paper 1.20

# Features
Commands include:
  - /lobby
  - /survival
  - /creative

If any player is in the lobby it forces the server selection screen on them. 

# Usage
Make sure three worlds with names: _lobby_, _survival_ and _creative_ exist. If they don't exist the plugin won't crash though.
